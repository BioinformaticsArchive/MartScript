MartScript
==========

MartScript is a simple non-branching imperative scripting language
for creating BioMarts automatically (i.e. non-interactively). The
language supports

 * extending Ensembl databases with custom data
 * automatisation of MartBuilder/MartEditor functionality
 * the creation and execution of a mart's SQL-commands

This is a fully functional release of MartScript as a beta version,
mainly due to the lack of documentation (will follow 'shortly') and
some minor cosmetic issues. However, we used MartScript in production
to create: [www.pubmed2ensembl.org](http://www.pubmed2ensembl.org)

Supporting Software
-------------------

MartScript depends on partially modified code of MartBuilder as well as as 
JAR files of several libraries that from the BioMart project, which are 
redistributed here. MartBuilder, MartEditor and the JAR-packaged files 
are released under LGPL.
