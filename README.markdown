MartScript
==========

MartScript is a simple non-branching imperative scripting language
for creating BioMarts (see [www.biomart.org](http://www.biomart.org)) 
automatically (i.e. non-interactively). The
language supports

 * extending Ensembl databases with custom data
 * automatisation of MartBuilder/MartEditor functionality
 * the creation and execution of a mart's SQL-commands

This is a fully functional release of MartScript as a beta version,
mainly due to the lack of documentation and
some minor cosmetic issues. However, we used MartScript in production
to create: [www.pubmed2ensembl.org](http://www.pubmed2ensembl.org)

MartScript depends on partially modified code of MartBuilder as well as as
