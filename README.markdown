MartScript
==========

MartScript is a simple non-branching imperative scripting language
for creating BioMarts automatically (i.e. non-interactively). The
language supports

 * extending Ensembl databases with custom data
 * automatisation of MartBuilder/MartEditor functionality
 * the creation and execution of a mart's SQL-commands

This is a fully functional release of MartScript as a beta version,
mainly due to the lack of documentation (will follow 'shortly') and
some minor cosmetic issues. However, we used MartScript in production
to create: [www.pubmed2ensembl.org](http://www.pubmed2ensembl.org)

MartScript itself is released under the 2-clause BSD License (see below),
but I am also redistributing the partially modified code of MartBuilder
and MartScript here, as well as JAR files of several libraries that are
necessary to run MartScript. MartBuilder, MartEditor and the JAR-packaged
files come with their own licenses that should be looked up on their
originating web-sites.
